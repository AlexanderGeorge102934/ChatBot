Below is a sample **README.md** you can adapt for your GitHub repository. It outlines how the chatbot project is structured, how to install dependencies, and how to run it.

# Chatbot Project

This repository contains a simple **Python chatbot** that uses:

- **Scikit-learn** classifiers for sentiment detection  
- **Word2Vec** embeddings (stored in `w2v.pkl`)  
- **Various stylistic analyses** (average sentence length, punctuation density, type-token ratio, etc.)  
- **Transcript processing** scripts to separate chatbot and user utterances

### What Each File Does

1. **`chatbot.py`**  
   - Contains the main logic for the chatbot:  
     - Loading data  
     - Computing Word2Vec embeddings  
     - Performing sentiment classification  
     - Conducting stylistic analyses  
   - The `run_chatbot(...)` function orchestrates the conversation flow.

2. **`process_transcripts.py`**  
   - Reads a transcript file (like `test.txt`) and produces three new files:
     - `all_test.txt` (all utterances)
     - `chatbot_test.txt` (only chatbot utterances)
     - `user_test.txt` (only user utterances)

3. **`analyze_transcripts.py`**  
   - Integrates with **TAACO** (if installed) to perform more advanced coherence analyses on transcripts.  
   - By default, it looks for a directory of processed transcripts and outputs a CSV with various metrics.

4. **`test.txt`**  
   - Example transcript showing how the chatbot’s dialogue is logged.

5. **`requirements.txt`**  
   - Lists all necessary Python dependencies (some may be from Anaconda distributions).

6. **`dataset.csv`**  
   - Labeled training data for sentiment analysis.  
   - If it’s large or proprietary, you may want to exclude it or include only a sample.

7. **`w2v.pkl`**  
   - Pretrained Word2Vec embeddings (often >1GB).  
   - You may want to host it externally if it’s too large.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-project.git
   cd chatbot-project
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   # or
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - If you find some packages unnecessary, you can remove them from `requirements.txt`.

4. **(Optional) Download NLTK Data**  
   - This project uses NLTK for tokenization. If you haven’t already downloaded the relevant data, do:
     ```python
     import nltk
     nltk.download('punkt')
     ```
   - Or let the code handle downloads automatically.

5. **Place `w2v.pkl` and `dataset.csv`**  
   - Ensure `w2v.pkl` and `dataset.csv` are located in the same directory as `chatbot.py`, unless you change file paths in the code.

## Usage

### Running the Chatbot Interactively

1. **Start the Chatbot**  
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```
2. **Enter responses** as prompted:
   - Name  
   - Topics to talk about  
   - Additional inputs for stylistic analysis  

The chatbot will log your conversation in a timestamped `.txt` file.

### Processing Transcripts

If you have a file like `test.txt` containing a transcript, run:
```bash
python process_transcripts.py
```
It will generate three new files in the same directory:
- `all_test.txt` (all utterances)
- `chatbot_test.txt` (chatbot-only utterances)
- `user_test.txt` (user-only utterances)

### Advanced Transcript Analysis (Optional)

If you have [**TAACO**](https://www.linguisticanalysistools.org/taaco.html) installed, you can run:
```bash
python analyze_transcripts.py
```
By default, this looks for a directory (e.g., `processed_transcripts/`) of transcripts and writes results to a CSV file.

## Customization

- **Switch Classification Models**  
  - In `chatbot.py`, see `instantiate_models()`. Uncomment or comment out the lines for `Naive Bayes`, `Logistic Regression`, `SVM`, or `MLP`.
  - Comment/uncomment the code for training them with TFIDF or Word2Vec.

- **Toggle TFIDF vs. Word2Vec**  
  - If you prefer TFIDF, use `vectorize_train()` and `train_model_tfidf()`.  
  - If you want Word2Vec, focus on `string2vec()`, `train_model_w2v()`, etc.

- **Add More Stylistic Features**  
  - Look at `custom_feature_1()` and `custom_feature_2()` in `chatbot.py` and add more sophisticated stylistic metrics.

---

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- **.gitignore**  
  - Exclude IDE folders (`.idea/`) and virtual environment directories (`venv/`), as well as any large files (like `w2v.pkl`) you don’t want on GitHub.

- **Stanford CoreNLP**  
  - The code calls `get_dependency_parse()` using a **CoreNLP server** on `http://localhost:9000`. If you don’t need dependency parsing, comment out related lines.

- **Large Files**  
  - If `w2v.pkl` or `dataset.csv` are huge, consider hosting them elsewhere (e.g., cloud storage) and updating the code accordingly.
